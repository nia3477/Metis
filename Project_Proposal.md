Project Proposal


Name: Nia Clark

Question:
The purpose of the model I am building is to utilize the MTA data set in order to place COVID-19 testing sites outside of the top 10 busiest stations in New York City. With omicron infection rates spiking, it is important to get as many people tested as possible in efforts to stop the spread. Organizations that specialize in healthcare benefit from this model. I plan to focus on helping City MD choose where to set up Covid-19 testing tents outside of the selected stations so that the maximum number of people hae access to testing sites.

Data Description:
The dataset I plan to use is the MTA Turnstile Data and it will be obtained through the MTA website. In the data I am looking at turnstile information at each station for each month, including what lines are available at each station and date time for entry and exists.

Tools:
I intend to meet the tools requirement of this project by using get_mta.py, querying from the database into python using SQLAlchemy, exploratory data analysis, and python visualization libraries. I am not planning to use additional tools beyond those required.
