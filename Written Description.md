#INCLUDE WHY I MADE MAX_COUNTER 100,000 - BECAUSE TO AVOID AN ANOMYLIES IN THE DATA

Abstract
######

The objective of this project was to use exploratory data analysis to provide insight on where urgent care center, City MD, should place COVID-19 testing sites around NYC. I worked with the MTA turnstile dataset in order to find the top 5 stations that received the most daily entries and by using this information, City MD will be able to place testing sites in front of these stations with the assumption that more people will mean more demand for COVID tests. With the use of SQL and Python, I was able to create tables and graphs to showcase my results.
